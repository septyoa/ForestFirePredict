# ForestFirePredict
This Machine Learning Model was built using Convolutional Neural Network to create the model that could predict whether the picture contains Forest Fire or not

## Dataset
The dataset used was from Kaggle Forest_Fire_BigData (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammedborhanuddin/forest-fire-bigdata)  
This dataset contains 1.832 files of Forest Fire Pictures and Non Forest Fire Pictures

## Machine Learning Model
This machine learning model was build using Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow  
This model gains accuracy score of 97% and consistent in every metrics  
The performance also balanced across fire and no fire category
